## Scene: What is Bitcoin?
**Narrative:**
Bitcoin is digital money that exists only on computers. Unlike physical cash, you can't hold it in your hand, but you can send it anywhere in the world instantly.

**Visual:**
1. Clear the screen.
2. Draw a large orange circle in the center. Inside it, write the Bitcoin symbol "₿".
3. Around the circle, draw 4 small computer icons (rectangles with screens) positioned North, South, East, and West.
4. Draw dotted lines connecting each computer to the Bitcoin symbol.
5. Animate everything fading in one by one.

## Scene: Traditional Money vs Bitcoin
**Narrative:**
Traditional money is controlled by banks and governments. Bitcoin has no central authority—it's managed by a network of computers working together.

**Visual:**
1. Split screen into LEFT and RIGHT halves.
2. LEFT side: Draw a grey building shape labeled "Bank" at the top. Below it, draw 3 stick figures. Draw arrows pointing from the stick figures UP to the bank.
3. RIGHT side: Draw 5 small squares arranged in a circle. Label them "Computer 1", "Computer 2", etc. Draw lines connecting all squares to each other (mesh pattern).
4. Above LEFT, write "Centralized". Above RIGHT, write "Decentralized".
5. Animate LEFT side first, then RIGHT side.

## Scene: What is a Blockchain?
**Narrative:**
A blockchain is like a digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. It's made of blocks of information, chained together in order.

**Visual:**
1. Clear the screen.
2. Draw 4 squares horizontally aligned in the center. Make them blue with white borders.
3. Label them from left to right: "Block 1", "Block 2", "Block 3", "Block 4".
4. Draw chain links (small connecting shapes) between each block.
5. Inside each block, write "Transactions" in small text.
6. Animate the blocks appearing from left to right with a sliding motion.

## Scene: How Transactions Work
**Narrative:**
When you send Bitcoin, the transaction is verified by the network and added to the blockchain. Everyone can see it, but your identity stays private.

**Visual:**
1. Keep the blockchain from the previous scene at the bottom (smaller).
2. At the top LEFT, draw a stick figure labeled "Alice".
3. At the top RIGHT, draw a stick figure labeled "Bob".
4. Draw a yellow coin with "₿" between them.
5. Animate the coin moving from Alice to Bob.
6. Then animate a copy of this transaction appearing inside "Block 4" on the blockchain below.
7. Make Block 4 glow green briefly.

## Scene: Why is it Secure?
**Narrative:**
Each block contains a unique code called a hash. If someone tries to change past transactions, the chain breaks, and everyone knows something is wrong.

**Visual:**
1. Clear the screen.
2. Draw 3 blocks horizontally: "Block A", "Block B", "Block C".
3. Inside each block, show a small code label: "Hash: abc123", "Hash: def456", "Hash: ghi789".
4. Connect them with green checkmark symbols.
5. Below, draw the same 3 blocks again, but show Block B with different text "Hash: XXX000".
6. Show the connections after Block B turning RED with X marks.
7. Add text below: "Chain broken = Easy to detect tampering!"

## Scene: Conclusion
**Narrative:**
Bitcoin combines cryptography, decentralization, and blockchain technology to create money that no single person or institution controls. That's the power of cryptocurrency.

**Visual:**
1. Clear the screen.
2. Draw 3 boxes arranged in a triangle formation (one at top, two at bottom).
3. Top box: Draw a lock icon and label "Cryptography".
4. Bottom LEFT: Draw a network mesh icon and label "Decentralization".
5. Bottom RIGHT: Draw connected blocks and label "Blockchain".
6. In the center of the triangle, draw a large orange Bitcoin symbol "₿" that glows.
7. Animate all elements fading in, with the Bitcoin symbol appearing last and pulsing.
