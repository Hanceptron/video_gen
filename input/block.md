## Scene: Opening Hook
**Narrative:**
Imagine a notebook that everyone can read, but no one can erase or cheat. That's blockchain. Let's break it down.

**Visual:**
1. Show title "What is Blockchain?" in large, bright text at the center
2. Fade in a simple notebook icon below the title
3. Animate the notebook opening with a glowing effect
4. Transition the scene by fading out

## Scene: The Traditional Problem
**Narrative:**
Right now, when you send money or share information online, you need someone in the middle - like a bank - to verify everything is legitimate.

**Visual:**
1. Show three icons in a row:
   - Left: Person A (simple stick figure)
   - Center: Bank building (simple icon with "BANK" label)
   - Right: Person B (simple stick figure)
2. Draw arrows from A to Bank, and Bank to B
3. Highlight the bank with a pulsing effect
4. Below, show text: "The Middleman Problem"

## Scene: The Blockchain Solution
**Narrative:**
Blockchain removes the middleman. Instead of one company controlling the records, thousands of computers around the world keep identical copies.

**Visual:**
1. Clear the previous scene
2. Show Person A and Person B again (left and right)
3. Instead of one bank, show multiple small computer icons scattered in the middle
4. Draw lines connecting all computers to each other (creating a network)
5. Show text below: "No Single Controller"

## Scene: How It Works - Blocks
**Narrative:**
Here's the magic: Information is stored in "blocks" - think of them as pages in a digital ledger. Each block contains transactions and is linked to the one before it.

**Visual:**
1. Show three connected boxes horizontally:
   - Label them "Block 1", "Block 2", "Block 3"
2. Draw chain links between them
3. Inside each block, show small lines representing "data"
4. Animate them appearing from left to right in sequence

---

## Scene: The Chain
**Narrative:**
Once a block is added, it can't be changed without everyone noticing. If someone tries to cheat, their version won't match the thousands of other copies.

**Visual:**
1. Keep the three blocks visible
2. Show one block flashing red with an "X" mark
3. Below it, show multiple green checkmarks representing other valid copies
4. Animate a "rejected" stamp on the red block
5. Show text: "Transparent & Secure"

---

## Scene: Real World Impact
**Narrative:**
This technology powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but it's also used for tracking products, securing medical records, and even digital art.

**Visual:**
1. Clear screen
2. Show four icons appearing one by one in a grid:
   - Bitcoin symbol (top left)
   - Medical cross (top right)
   - Shipping box (bottom left)
   - Picture frame/art (bottom right)
3. Label each with small text: "Crypto", "Healthcare", "Supply Chain", "NFTs"

---

## Scene: Closing
**Narrative:**
Blockchain is simply a way to record information that's transparent, secure, and doesn't need a middleman. That's the future of trust in the digital age.

**Visual:**
1. Show title text appearing: "Blockchain = Trust Without Middlemen"
2. Below it, animate three key points appearing:
   - "✓ Transparent"
   - "✓ Secure"
   - "✓ Decentralized"
3. Fade to end screen
